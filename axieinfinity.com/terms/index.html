ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h2><p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</p><p>A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Axies, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Axies will not lose money.</p><p>B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Axie-related transactions. Axie Infinity is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.</p><p>C. The App does not store, send, or receive Axies. This is because Axies exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain on the Ronin network. Any transfer of Axies occurs only on the Ronin network.</p><p>D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Axie Infinity will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ronin network, however caused.</p><p>E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.</p><p>F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.</p><p>G. Upgrades by Sky Mavis to the Ronin Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all Axie Infinity assets.</p><h2>15. INDEMNIFICATION</h2><p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses, made by third party due to or arising out of: (1) use of the Site, (2) breach of these Terms of Use, (3) any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in these Terms of Use, (4) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, or (5) any overt harmful act toward any other use of the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts with whom you connected via the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts.
