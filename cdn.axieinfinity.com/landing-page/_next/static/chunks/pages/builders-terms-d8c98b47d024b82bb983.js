Applications will be judged on creativity, general usefulness and feasibility of the project, potential positive impact on the Axie Infinity community, and technical quality (including documentation). The table below describes the process for applying for a Grant and guidelines that applications must follow in order to submit an application, and also list several application types that the Company is looking to have extended or built by the community. The types of projects that the Company is interested in may be found at: <https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-builders-program?s=r>\n\n  |  |  |\n  | - | - |\n  | Step 1 | To Register, you must fill an Axie Infinity Builders Program Application Form ("**Application Form**") that describes your project and its goals, the team that will be working on the project, and how the project will enhance or contribute to the Axie Infinity ecosystem.

Further communication may also be required to determine specific details around timelines, deliverables and Grant dates. The Company will notify you whether you application has been approved, if it is subject to conditions and what Grant size your project will receive. More complex projects may take longer to evaluate.
