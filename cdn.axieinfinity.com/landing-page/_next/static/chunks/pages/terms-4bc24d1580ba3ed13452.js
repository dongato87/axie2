It also enables users to own and transfer other digital assets like plots of land and items. These assets can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the "Site"). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the \u201cApp\u201d. Using the App, users can view their assets and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, battle, and breed creatures with other App users.\n\nWE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS.

FEE AND PAYMENT\n\nAny purchases (breeding Axies, buying Axies) from the site or marketplace will be done through smart contracts on a blockchain using a wallet like Metamask or Ronin wallet.

The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.\n\nIn addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 4.25% of the total value of that transaction (each, a \u201cCommission\u201d).

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n11.1 Informal negotiations\n\nTo expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a \u201cDispute" and collectively, the \u201cDisputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a \u201cParty" and collectively, the \u201cParties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating the arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.\n\n11.2 Binding Arbitration\n\nIf a Party is unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA\'s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (\u201cAAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitration compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all the arbitration fees and expenses. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AA rules or applicable law, the arbitration can take place in the Cayman Islands. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n\nIf for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the Cayman Islands, and the Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.\n\nIn no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of the action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n\n11.3 Exceptions to the Informal Negotiations and Arbitration\n\nThe Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provision concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, and of the intellectual property rights of a Party, (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal and unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n\n## 12.

ASSUMPTION OF RISK\n\nYou accept and acknowledge each of the following:\n\nA. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Axies, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Axies will not lose money.\n\nB. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Axie-related transactions. Axie Infinity is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.\n\nC. The App does not store, send, or receive Axies. This is because Axies exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App\u2019s supporting blockchain on the Ronin network. Any transfer of Axies occurs only on the Ronin network.\n\nD. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Axie Infinity will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ronin network, however caused.\n\nE. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.\n\nF. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.\n\nG. Upgrades by Sky Mavis to the Ronin Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all Axie Infinity assets.\n\n## 15.
